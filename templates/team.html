                    <td>I enjoy team-based projects due to the scale of collaboration involved.
                        I have a deep appreciation for the surprises faced when meeting with the creativity and work
                        ethic of
                        other minds.
                        This led me to realise the importance of keeping my colleagues motivated therefore I tend to
                        take on roles that involve boosting morale by maintaining a positive attitude and diffusing
                        conflicts.

                    </td>
                    <td>I make sure to communicate with each team member regarding their experiences to understand
                        how I can best leverage their skills. I find that this helps build a proper picture of the
                        project being managed, and helps spot bottlenecks.</td>
                    <td>I try my best to maintain a pleasant attitude as I understand the importance of the effect it
                        has on those around me.
                        I believe being pleasant and enjoyable to work with takes the bore out of a project and
                        genuinely motivates the team to go the extra mile.
